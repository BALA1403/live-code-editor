## üîß Technical Details

### Architecture Overview
The Live Code Editor employs a client-side architecture built entirely with vanilla web technologies:

- **Frontend Framework**: Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no external dependencies)
- **Code Execution**: Iframe-based sandboxed environment
- **Real-Time Updates**: Event-driven programming with DOM manipulation
- **Responsive Design**: CSS Grid and Flexbox layout systems

### Performance Optimizations
- **Debounced Input Handling**: Prevents excessive re-rendering during rapid typing
- **Efficient DOM Updates**: Minimal DOM manipulation for better performance
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of event listeners and temporary elements
- **Browser Compatibility**: Cross-browser tested and optimized

### Security Considerations
- **Sandboxed Execution**: Code runs in isolated iframe environment
- **XSS Protection**: Input sanitization and content security policies
- **Safe Code Execution**: No server-side code execution risks
- **Client-Side Only**: All processing happens in the user's browser

### Browser Support
- **Modern Browsers**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (latest versions)
- **Mobile Browsers**: iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile, Samsung Internet
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Graceful degradation for older browsers
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader compatible and keyboard navigable
